# Search by domain

This extension helps to open google `site:` search with optional queries.

The queries textarea can one or more queries split by new line.

For example:

- Domain: `github.com`
- Queries: 
    ```
    mendz
    microsoft
    google
    ```

Will open 3 tabs with the searches:
1. `site:github.com mendz`
2. `site:github.com microsoft`
3. `site:github.com google`
